# **COVID Tracker App**

The **COVID Tracker App** is a powerful tool that provides real-time insights on COVID-19 statistics. It fetches global and country-wise data on cases, deaths, and recoveries from an external API, displaying this information with interactive charts and maps. The app focuses on providing a seamless user experience with clean animations, optimized code, and maintainable design patterns.

## **Features**

### 1. **Real-Time COVID-19 Statistics**
- Track the latest stats, including confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths.
- Data is updated in real-time from a reliable COVID-19 API.

### 2. **Country-wise Data Tracking**
- Users can view statistics for individual countries.
- Easy search and selection to get specific country details.
- Filters for daily, weekly, and cumulative data.

### 3. **Interactive Map and Charts**
- Visualize global or regional spread using dynamic **map charts**.
- Detailed insights through bar graphs and pie charts for country-wise comparisons.

### 4. **Smooth Animations**
- Incorporates animations for data transitions, chart updates, and page navigation to provide a fluid user experience.

### 5. **Optimized Code**
- The app is built with performance in mind, reducing API call times and optimizing UI rendering.
- Follows best coding practices for maintainability and scalability.

### 6. **Quality Design Patterns**
- Uses clean and modular design patterns such as **MVVM** or **Provider** for state management.
- Ensures the app is easy to update and scale as new features are introduced.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Flutter/Dart** for mobile development
- **REST API** for fetching COVID-19 data
- **Provider/MVVM** for state management
- **Chart and Map Libraries** for data visualization
- **Animations** for enhancing user experience

## **Setup and Installation**

### Prerequisites
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed on your local machine.
- Access to a reliable COVID-19 data API (e.g., [disease.sh](https://disease.sh/) API).

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/covid-tracker-app.git
   cd covid-tracker-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## **API Integration**
- Fetches real-time data using the COVID-19 API.
- API endpoints are optimized for country-wise and global data.

## **Code Optimization**
- Clean, maintainable code with clear separation of logic and UI.
- Efficient handling of API calls and caching for faster data retrieval.
- Follows the **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle for reusability.
